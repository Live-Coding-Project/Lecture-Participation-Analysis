,Timestamp,Email Address,Review,Review: Do the mystery function modify its input parameter (img) within the function or does it create a new image? How do you know this from the code? Explain your answer.,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,What is one key idea that you learned in today's class? (2- 3 sentences),What questions do you still have about today's lecture? OR What did you find the most confusing about today's lecture?
