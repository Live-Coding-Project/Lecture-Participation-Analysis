We can evaluate whether a relation is true or not using Booleans. The common operators are ""==, >=, <=, !="". Besides this, we can evaluate the value of an expression with several statement that are connected by and, or, and not. The order for doing this is not, and, and or.","I think the most confusing part is to write if/elif under the framework of a function, especially when we have multiple parameters in a function. Also, as the code getting longer, I'm quite confused about the indentation."

Also the use of boolean statements in if statements, and how to properly indent lines and statements in my function in order to have the proper return and print statements. I also learned the importance of order of defining a function before being able to call it.","From today's lecture I think the syntax of defining if statements, and using the else statement and indentation were tricky, and also having to return a value. But I went to office hours today with the tutors and it was super helpful and I am clear on it now."
