",Error: Cannot have an if statement within another if statement,I learned about booleans and the importance of indenting and making sure the values are in the right spacing. I learned this because I ran into many indentation errors.,I don't know if it is me typing my information wrong but the auto-indentation is wrong for me and I have a hard time going back and figuring out where I need to add or take away indentations for my code to compute properly.

In the speed limit example there were many different ways to relay the message slow down when a car was driving too fast for the condition,I found the last section about if without else confusing. I don't understand the advantages of using this method.
