Two things are wrong that cause the image intensity to not be preserved: you first normalize the kernel by dividing by its maximum value, then in the convolution you divide by the number of samples in the kernel. Instead of these two normalizations, normalize just once, when you create the kernel, by dividing by the sum of the kernel values. This makes the sum of the kernel weights equal 1, and causes the convolution to preserve the average image intensity. Note that the convolution computes a local weighted average; in a weighted average we need the weights to add to 1 to avoid a bias."
