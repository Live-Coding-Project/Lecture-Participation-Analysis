120,2022-05-12 15:20:32.101,anc023@ucsd.edu,,,,,I found the colors a little confusing and implementing files.
121,2022-05-12 15:20:34.078,kpbrewster@ucsd.edu,It prints out the RGB tuples of each pixel that makes up the image.,"This function is turning specific parts of the image white, the entire thing starts out black",,I learned a lot about how to darken/change the color of an image by editing the tuples containing rgb values,"I still struggle with writing 2d loops from scratch, especially w the new content"
122,2022-05-12 15:20:41.259,ssenanayake@ucsd.edu,When we run print(image) the tuples of every single pixel in the image are printed.,The mystery function makes it white.,B,"One key idea I learned in today's class is how to import a module correctly. There are two ways, the way using the asterisk does not require you to continue typing in the name of the module every time you want to use it.",nothing
123,2022-05-12 15:21:00.741,jiz122@ucsd.edu,there are so many pixels come up since the image is large,the purpose it is for making the all white picture to have some part black,B,Image transforming and do checker patterns ,
124,2022-05-12 15:21:14.595,ruh004@ucsd.edu,it will  keep returning the tuples,the function is black out the region. ,,We have learned about image transformation and how to black out a region on a image. ,
125,2022-05-12 15:21:37.529,ejnguyen@ucsd.edu,,,,I learned about the process for coding for image transformations. You do incremental coding by starting with a small image and blacking out the part of the image you're working with.,I'm still a little confused by what the specific image functions do (the ones that are already defined)
126,2022-05-12 15:37:36.254,kaqian@ucsd.edu,,,,I learned how to use the CSE8A module to import images and convert them to strings. This is useful for when you want to modify images.,I am confused about all the functions in the CSE8A module.
127,2022-05-12 15:39:09.683,nhong@ucsd.edu,,,,I learned how color sections of an image and how to apply filters on an image. I also learned how 2d lists are utilized in an image.,I'm still confused on how to set up the nested for loop for images. 
128,2022-05-12 15:50:04.513,c6luo@ucsd.edu,,,,Tuples are immutable. So we need to use nested_for loop to modify the image.,
129,2022-05-12 15:54:47.343,erko@ucsd.edu,The RGB tuples of the pixels of the image will be printed.,,,,
130,2022-05-12 15:54:55.098,melai@ucsd.edu,Nothing will print because the pixels need to be turned into a text file so that the 2d list with tuples can print,,,,
131,2022-05-12 15:55:00.234,jtgonzales@ucsd.edu,A lot of lists will be printed.,,,,
132,2022-05-12 16:20:36.431,tschalge@ucsd.edu,print(image) will print the values of every single pixel in a list. ,This mystery blacks out roughly the first top fourth of the image.,A,"I learned more about the CSE8AImage module. Specifically, I learned what load_img(filename), and save_img(img, filename) functions do.",

135,2022-05-12 17:36:54.058,ssreenivasan@ucsd.edu,,"The mystery function takes a created image of height 8, width 8 pixels, and color white and changes the bottom half of it to the color black. It then saves the new image within the file called mystery.txt.",B,"There are two ways to import a module into Python. You can either use the syntax import module and then write ‘module.function’ whenever it is used, or you can say from module import * which will import everything, and there won’t be a need to do module.function, so you can just use the functions directly.","I found the checkerboard example a little confusing with the manipulation of rows and columns, and would like a little more practice with that!"
136,2022-05-12 18:28:25.820,mcmckelv@uscd.edu,error?,,B,I learned more about how to create images and python and tuples!,
137,2022-05-12 19:40:39.332,zhw011@ucsd.edu,"print out ""image""","First half lists inside the first half rows are changed to (0,0,0).",D,Locate position inside an image.,
138,2022-05-12 19:48:04.192,eekgasit@ucsd.edu,,,,"I learned about functions to get the height and width of the image. I also learned about importing modules in a way that allows functions to be used directly, without the name of the module.",none
139,2022-05-12 21:10:45.592,mepan@ucsd.edi,The image will printed.,I think the purpose of the mystery function is to set a foundation to create an image.,C,"In today's class, I learned about how to transform images. Also, I learned about how to do checker pattern.",
140,2022-05-12 21:37:07.642,slanaspa@ucsd.edu,it will return the tuples that code for the image,this image makes all of the values black so you cannot see what image it is,D,"I learned how images are refered to in order to choose specific sections of the images. Also, I learned how to use nested if loops to edit images.","I still have a hard time understanding the meaning of the code with images and nested for loops, for example when the height is divided and why"
141,2022-05-12 21:44:52.274,egaver@ucsd.edu,i am not sure,it it makes half the image black,D,we can transform images to be differently coloured but still the same image shown. each pixel cannot be changed but can be replaced,confusing is the idea of replacing rather than changing
142,2022-05-12 22:17:58.621,hchavarria@ucsd.edu,,,B,"I learned that although tuples are immutable, we could still change them. By this I mean change the colors or add other shades on rope of individual pixels. ",I found the concept of tuples most confusing and how python doesn’t confuse it with a string. 
143,2022-05-12 22:41:27.372,aodintsov@ucsd.edu,It will return an error,The mystery function turns the top left quadrant of the image black,B,One key idea I learned was that you can change the color or brightness of certain parts of an image using python. I was surprised at how few lines are needed to make a big difference in an image,How checker patterns work using create_img
144,2022-05-12 23:53:04.442,argonzalez@ucsd.edu,It will print the RGB of each pixel,This mystery function is using a nested loop in order to display a whole image with an even width. Than that image is being saved to mystery.txt at the end,B,I learned more about nested for loops and I learned about calling 2d lists and arrays. I also learned about displaying images and pixels both visually and in RGB form of the pixels.,Calling the images in RGB form and using 2d arrays is still a bit confusing.
145,2022-05-12 23:55:47.787,mepan@ucsd.edu,The function will print the image,I think the purpose is to set the foundation of creating an image.,B,I learned how to transform an image. Then I learned how to do checker pattern.,
