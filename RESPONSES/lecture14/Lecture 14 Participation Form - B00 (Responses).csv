302,2022-05-12 12:23:31.855,sgomezmartinez@ucsd.edu,,,,A key idea that I learned is that I should pay attention to height and width. It's important to keep these things in mind because it can make filters work wrongly.,The most confusing thing was still tuples and how they interact with the rest of the code.,,
303,2022-05-12 12:23:37.156,pfuentes@ucsd.edu,,It will print out the image ,C,I learned of the different ways we can interact with images using 2d lists. It was also interesting to see how designers/programmers could you python to aid their art!,I guess the part of img to file part.,,

I understand how to use the CSE8A library more. ,I don't think I was very confused at all during today's lecture since it was all broken down very well. But perhaps I will have some confusion when I dive deeper into the PA. ,,

I also learned that tuples are immutable",What I found most confusing was all the functions we created to deal with images,,
308,2022-05-12 12:23:52.389,m5lee@ucsd.edu,,,,I overall just got a better understanding of how to target specific parts of an image for transformation (or the whole image).  I was struggling a bit on the lab with doing some of the image transformations but this lecture helped to solidify some of those ideas so I feel more confident in completing that now.,No questions,,
309,2022-05-12 12:23:53.038,ejs001@ucsd.edu,,,,"One key idea that I learned was about how to reduce brightness in an image by making sure to get the correct range. Then, I learned how this image transformation can be applied even further to make certain sections of the image into different colors. ",No questions ,,

318,2022-05-12 12:26:04.015,jom009@ucsd.edu,,,,Today A key idea I learned was how to incorporate real images from the CSE8AImage library. A big thing was how to prevent an error when relating to this situation and properly incorporate in the code ,I dont really have anything for right now ,,

I also learned hoe to transform images both from lecture and in lab. Thank you so much and have a great day.",One thing that is still a little bit confusing from lecture is the math aspect of the lecture and the conceptualizing of the code. Other than that nothing super confusing was taught in lecture and professor did a great job of explaining everything throughly.,,

We say this method being used in the checkered method that was provided in the lecture.","No questions, there was nothing confusing",,

We also use tuples, which are immutable, to play around with the pixel values. 2D lists of tuples can represent color information of pixels in images.",How can we incorporate functions when dealing with images? ,,

This means they cannot be changed.,2D lists and creating an image is still a buit confusing ,2D list of tuples,The index will be out of range
327,2022-05-12 12:34:49.344,mmao@ucsd.edu,,,D,"One key idea I learned today is how to do basic transformation of an image. This can be done by defining functions and using different parameters like img, levels, height, width, and starting points. The parameters will help define/target certain pixels in the image for the transformation to occur.

",B,I learned that images can be transformed by swapping height/width values in python. I also learned that patterns can also be made as a filter. ,I think the most confusing was probably edge cases,2D list of tuples,It will invert!

This way, it'll be taken as a tuple, not a string.",,2D list of tuples,

I also learned about the mystery function. ,Nothing yet.,2D list of tuples, If you swap the height and the width then the image will look like it is backwards.

Moreover, we also learned how to transform images. ",I'm curious and still a little confused about how could we transform images based on its column instead of row. ,,
338,2022-05-13 00:15:23.092,adobbins@ucsd.edu,,"This code is first creating an all black 8x8 image (height 8, width 8). It then passes this image to the mystery function, which makes the lower left corner of the image all white. In other words, you can thing of the original image being an all black square, and the mystery function makes the third quadrant all white. Then the data of this image is put into a text file.",A,"I learned that when you change the range of the code you can only manage to run it if it is within the img parameters, but once you pass a certain number you encounter an error. I also learned that you can change the brightness of an img using code functions.",I am still a little confused on the mystery function.,,
