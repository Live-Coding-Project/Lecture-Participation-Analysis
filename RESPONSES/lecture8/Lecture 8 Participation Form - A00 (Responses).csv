I also learned how to motify them in differnet situations. ,"When reviewing the work, I need to define the big ideas to the concept they are explaining as I still review the lecture. "
535,2022-04-21 18:41:07.717,dnkim@ucsd.edu,This loop will be infinite because it will keep going.,3 references and 3 objects,,,,,,I learned that for and while loops are different. While is conditional and will do the task until proven false.,
536,2022-04-21 21:27:04.068,mbarawid@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,,"One key idea that I learned in today's class was references and objects. For instance, references refer to the variables that call a certain list, string, or integer. The objects on the other hand, are the given integer, string, or list that come from the reference. In addition, to references and objects, I learned how to modify them in order to change what the references call (objects). ","In regards to today's lecture, I was confused on the final section that we were learning. This was basic list methods and basic string methods, and understanding how to apply ""append,"" ""insert,"" and ""remove,"" will take some time and practice. "

And, when you do modifying a String within a Function, once that string has modified, from next line it's going to be replaced, and the previous value before modifying is gone.","The concept of modifying was a bit complex to me. I'd like to have a more explanation by using several types of examples, if possible."
538,2022-04-21 23:23:56.688,jnhuynh@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,,Lists can be replaced by one another.,"I don't have a clear question, but I do have confusion. I'll look over the lecture to try and clear it."

540,2022-04-22 13:00:15.564,yiperez@ucsd.edu,,,,,,None of the above,3.0,I learned that we can split a list by using the split function and entering the marker for said split. I also learned that we can use the .insert/remove/append functions in order to add or remove functions from a list. ,"I am still confused about how to write infinite functions with conditions, especially when those conditions include it is divisible by a certain number or positive/negative.
