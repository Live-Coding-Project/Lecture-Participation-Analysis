For example, in question 1, we defined min_pos= 0, however, in the second question, we didn't define any variable like that. Therefore, how do I know when to do that?"

479,2022-04-19 15:53:17.655,kochoa@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,"Always the word ""live"" will be printed always without any error",One key idea that I learned in todayâ€™s class is that there is a difference between a for and while loop. A while loop is used when you are not sure how many times something will be repeated. A for loop is used when you are sure of how many times you are going to repeat something.,What I found most confusing was how to implement the for and while loops into a code.
480,2022-04-19 17:07:38.271,mbarawid@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,,"One key idea that I learned in today's class was the difference between ""for"" and ""while"" loops. For instance, we would utilize ""for"" loops when the coder knows the number of iterations (items) that are present before entering the loop. On the other hand, we would utilize ""while"" loops when the coder does not know the number of iterations before entering the loop. ","I was confused about while loops in general because I still haven't fully grasped ""for"" loops. As a result, when I was trying to follow along with the lecture I was having difficulty understanding the purpose of making the length and parameter = 0, while returning another number such as ""-1."" (This was from the review exercise)."

I think that we didn't get to cover the full scope of why you might need one. When I used break statements before, it was just because my code didn't have proper conditions to exit the loop. Is there a situation where a break statement is better than creating more foolproof conditionals?"
