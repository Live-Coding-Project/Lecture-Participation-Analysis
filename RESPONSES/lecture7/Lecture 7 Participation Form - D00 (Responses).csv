If the user’s password does not meet the criteria (at least 8 characters), you should prompt the user to try again. Which loop will you use here and why?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scenario 2: You want to loop through a list of student names and print their names in a specified format (last, first). Which loop will you use and why?",Big idea #5,What is one key idea that you learned in today's class? (2- 3 sentences),What questions do you still have about today's lecture? OR What did you find the most confusing about today's lecture?

","Any of the three words ""live"", ""love"", and ""laugh"" will be printed but sometimes an error may be thrown",How to make more complex function that iterate doing something over and over many times. How to use the iteration value to determine and change things over different times a loop is run.,I think the most confusing part is sometimes the language gets confusing in for loops when you are trying to figure out how to keep track of the iteration.

I learn that the difference between while loop and a if statement is that one goes to the next portion while while loop keeps checking over and over until it is false.,The question I have is with while loop what if you never get a false in you code and it is always true can that be possible? I don't understand the infinite loop and when you get an error or how it works with while loop.
