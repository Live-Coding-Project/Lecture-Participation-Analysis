681,2022-04-19 22:27:42.884,adobbins@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,,A key idea I learned in today's class is that for loops have a specific number of iterations that runs in accordance to the elements of the list and a while loop has an infinite amount of iterations until the program is stopped. This is important because you want to ensure that for specific conditions the loops will continuously run until you get the output you are looking for in some cases.,I am still a little confused on the break function
