If the userâ€™s password does not meet the criteria (at least 8 characters), you should prompt the user to try again. Which loop will you use here and why?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scenario 2: You want to loop through a list of student names and print their names in a specified format (last, first). Which loop will you use and why?",Big idea #5,What is one key idea that you learned in today's class? (2- 3 sentences),What questions do you still have about today's lecture? OR What did you find the most confusing about today's lecture?

In other words, you want the code to iterate an indefinite amount of times so long as the password does not meet the criteria.

Scenario 2: You would use a for loop since you want to iterate through a list a finite amount of times, the amount of times in this case being the length of the list.","Any of the three words ""live"", ""love"", and ""laugh"" will be printed but sometimes an error may be thrown",The main difference between while loops and for loops is that for loops are used mainly to iterate through a definite amount of times whereas while loops are used mainly to iterate through an indefinite amount of times. I also learned that break ends the while loop under a certain condition if used in conjunction with an if statement.,
