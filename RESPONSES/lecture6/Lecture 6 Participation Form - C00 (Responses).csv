They are for repeating an action multiple times without having to write the same code multiple times, as it redefines the variable as it runs. ",I found it difficult sometimes to track the progress of a for loop.
421,2022-04-14 22:28:22.451,mmsantacruz@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,I learned what for loops are and ranges. There was also some review of lists that helped me understand concepts from last lecture that I didn't understand.,"The most difficult part of today's lecture was the for loops with variable updates, it was difficult to follow what was happening."

424,2022-04-15 01:04:52.171,kcancel@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,One key idea I learned in lecture today is that strings can function the same way as lists. Meaning we can apply the same functions to strings to be able to output similar results to what we did with lists. Differences include elements vs characters and similarities include how we count and label during indexing and slicing. ,"For the question on big idea #1, why doesnâ€™t the whole name get printed? "

What I da also learned was how to exactly do range and where and when to stop it as. ,"What I found confusing was the range, I don't know where to stop like if it starts at 0 or if it starts at 1."
427,2022-04-15 10:58:30.032,umukherjee@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,I learned about combining for loops with if statements. This allows us to test the entire sequence. ,I think a confusing element was numbering each part of a list.
