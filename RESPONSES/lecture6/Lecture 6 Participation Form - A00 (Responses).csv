I also learned how the name of the variable when it is being called in a loop is very important when combining slicing. ,"The loop function in conjunction with splits is still a little confusing for me. I sort of understand them independently of each other but when put together in the same code, it can be a little confusing as of right now. "
400,2022-04-14 13:34:50.394,s3cho@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,One key idea that I learned in today's lecture is loop and range. Using loop and list make a code and how to print the output.,Today I'm good. Thank you

402,2022-04-14 14:58:51.447,yiperez@ucsd.edu,,,,12.0,3 only,-1.0,Today I learned that we don't always have to use the def feature in order to define a variable. I also learned that we can take the length and product of names if we use the len and * features. More importantly we can set our code up in a way that allows us to not have to enter every number we want to use but embed it with the result * num(variable) feature. ,"I am still a little confused on how these codes work. I feel like I understand the material in class but when it comes to the homework I struggle to write the codes myself. I think it would greatly help if I knew why we use the functions, what words to pay attention to when writing code, and knowing when these functions apply. "

404,2022-04-14 21:25:55.670,fmassa@ucsd.edu,,,,20.0,,0.0,"I learned that you should initialize a variable to 1 or 0 before you use it in a loop. If you don't do this, then the variable will be undefined and the loop cannot be evaluated. ","Some of the math operations are still intimidating, especially the more complicated ones like factorials. I would like a better explanation for how these concepts work within python. "
405,2022-04-14 21:35:03.780,stseo@ucsd.edu,,,,12.0,3 only,2.0,I learned more about loops in how it is repeating that will help me solve questions on stepik and PA. I also learned more on how we could apply conditionals to our loops. ,I found the part about getting the results on the loops still somewhat confusing.

For example, range (stop), range(start, stop), and range(start, stop, step), and how the numbers will behave for each of the scenarios. ","I think I didn't quite understand the whole for loop idea, especially using conditionals in for loops. But I believe doing more reading and practice and re-watching lecture would help me understand it better."
