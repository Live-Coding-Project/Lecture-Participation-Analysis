Ultimately, I'm able to obtain a value/key from a dictionary utilizing tuples as either keys or values. ","In regards to today's lecture, I felt like I generally understood the majority of the concepts, since the live coding examples helped me understand. A slight confusion would be nested for loops found within ""dictionaries with dictionaries as values"". This was the case, because I can see how the long code could be tedious and confusing when calling the dictionaries within the dictionaries and wanting a desired output. For example, I could accidentally call a wrong dictionary value, causing me to obtain a wrong output. "
