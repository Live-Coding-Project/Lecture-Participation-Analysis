An example of this is by modifying the RGB inputs for any tuple in the function ""create_img"".",I found modifying images in a function to be a bit confusing.,I felt a little more understanding.
220,2022-05-17 17:25:00.963,mljimenez@ucsd.edu,,,,"One key idea that I learned today was how to make a checkered pattern in a specific area. I also learned more about image transformations and how they work, how to make specific patterns. ","I understood today's lecture and was not confused, I also do not have any questions. ","I am feeling good about image transformations, I feel that I have a good understanding about how to do them. "
221,2022-05-17 17:27:39.156,zwilliams@ucsd.edu,"This program is taking the height, width, and img that is in tuples of 8x8. Then it divides the tuple by 8 // 2 which changes the 8x8 range to a 4x4 range and turning the img in those tuples black. Then is finally displays the new img once the loops are done updating ",B,Growth,The importance of understanding how to format the code. Because before I was having a hard time understanding how and where the argument are supposed to go,N/a,A bit better
222,2022-05-17 18:24:08.769,juc010@ucsd.edu,,,This function is simply reprinting the same img over again as a 2d list. A name for it would be either save or reprint function. ,From today's class I learned how to modify just a section of an image. The quadrants were helpful to learn and also will come in handy when I am only trying to change one corner of an image. ,I am confused how today's lecture fits with the lessons in stepik. I wish we went over modifying images more. ,"I am still a bit wary of them, and I'm hoping for more explanation on it. "
223,2022-05-17 18:55:51.131,b1lin@ucsd.edu,,,The purpose of this function is to duplicate this image to save as a new 2d list.,"In today's class, we continued to study image transformation, especially focusing on doing checker patterns step by step. We also learned to modify images in a function.",I think the part talking about modifying a new image in a function is challenging. I still feel a little confused about that. ,"I think image transformations are interesting, magical, and also helpful. With this kind of coding skills, we don't need to use Photoshop anymore. lol. "

226,2022-05-17 21:52:20.202,jtm002@ucsd.edu,,,,"One key idea I learned in class is understanding the importance of indexing when dealing with images. For example the checkered image requires understanding where the pixels are in a 2d list, without this it is impossible to apply specific modification to a certain region. Knowing about the indexes allows for much more complicated image transformations.",No questions really I feel much better about the material.,I feel much more confident on transformations specifically with indexing. For me I find that the least intuitive part but I feel I understand now.
