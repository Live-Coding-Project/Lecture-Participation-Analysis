As a result, this would be the end of the height and width for a given image. ","One key idea that I learned in today's class was how to transform a specific location within an image. For instance, we completed the process of creating a checkered pattern onto the cat image. Calling various variables such as, ""end_row = start_row + length"", or ""end_col = start_col + length"", creating a nested for loop, and if/else statements will allow me to ultimately reach the goal of changing a specific location within an image. ","In regards to today's lecture, I was confused on ""Big Idea #4: Modifying a New Image in a Function."" For example, when dealing with merging colors there appears to be other variables at the bottom of the code that write the RGB tuple. The code example visually appears confusing but after more explanation, and applying previous ideas that I've learned, the code will be easier to understand. ","I think I get the general idea about image transformations. For instance, after completing the Stepik assignments and working on the PA6, I understand how to work the with import of ""CSE8AImage"". In addition, I understand how to alter image colors through the RGB tuples, how to specify the column and row, write nested for loops for image changes, how to create an image (and so on). However, when I complete image transformations I look back on previous works that I've completed such as the labs and Stepik, since I think the process can be tedious. "
219,2022-05-17 12:33:48.560,hjfernandez@ucsd.edu,,,,One key idea that i learned in today's class involved the ranges in which only certain parameters of an image are affected by the code. You have to define the specificities of a row or a column. ,I think I still need practice with the whole concepts or big ideas from today's lecture as I am still extremely confused. ,I am feeling better but still confused.

First, the function enters a for loop condition, where for each row in the range of the height of an image, a new list of row is created. Then, for each column in the range of the width of an image, the function adds the pixel at that row and column to the row list, and then adds that row list to a result list. The function will iterate this for each row and column value until it returns result, which is a list of list of rows.
