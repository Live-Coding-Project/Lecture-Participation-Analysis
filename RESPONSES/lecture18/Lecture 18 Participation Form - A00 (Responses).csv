For instance, when creating comma separated values, we first have a variable that calls a list. As a result, we can call the variable and the values within the list for a desired output. This was the case demonstrated through exercises #7-9 as we call the position within the list, then we would specify what string we wanted to check the value of. This would then return the desired output. ","Confusion that I had within this lecture was how to use the CSE8ACSV Library for data processing. The general idea and process that we saw in the live coding example was identical to the exercises 7-9, so I would just need to practice more on how to work with the import of CSE8ACSV.
