If we change the return statements to print statements, then the code will not return the final ""hour is invalid"" string because there is no return statement for the function to refer back to. The return statement is not within the function. ",,,,,,"One key idea that I learned today was the formatting of the midterm. The review helped me understand that I would need to go over all of the lecture slides and primarily focus on for loops and while loops. This is the case since I struggled to answer these questions, so going over these topics will prepare me for the midterm. ","In regards to today's lecture, I found for loops, and while loops the most difficult. For example, the problems that involved writing out the code, or fixing coding errors was the hardest portion. As a result, I would need to review these concepts to help prepare myself for the midterm. ","I thought that the midterm review was very helpful in going over all of the topics, and guiding me toward which concepts I need to work on more. In order to make the review session better, maybe we could implement more coding problems since I think this is the hardest part of the exam. This would be problems that involve explaining the error, fixing the error, then rewriting the code. "
