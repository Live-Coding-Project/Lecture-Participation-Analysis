The issue with the code is in the loop, where the length of the list in an index exceeds the list, and would proceed an error. A way to fix this would be to type out the loop as:

We want the length of the list to be subtracted by one because indexes start off at zero, whereas the length count of a list starts off at 1.

This will add 0, 1, and 2 to the total at each iteration of the for loop instead of the actual values in nums. This can be fixed by removing the range and length functions and instead writing the for loop for just the list nums. The correct code should look like this:
