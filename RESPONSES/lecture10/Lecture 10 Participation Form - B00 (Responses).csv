I may have relearned some concepts such as range since I haven't used range much in my coding as of lately so I remember now when to use range and in what instances to use.,I didn't really find much confusing today everything was easily answered and if I got it wrong when professor explained I easily knew my mistake. ,The midterm review was very helpful it was very needed to know what I'd also need to review more to be more prepared for the midterm.
