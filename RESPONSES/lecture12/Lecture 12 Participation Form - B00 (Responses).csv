I liked how there were different question formats. I also liked how we were asked to explain our code over video (like with the PAs) because that really tests and enhances our understanding. It does seem like it would be very easy to lose points on many of the questions. I wish the rubrics for each question were stated explicitly. Some instructions seem intentionally a bit vague.
