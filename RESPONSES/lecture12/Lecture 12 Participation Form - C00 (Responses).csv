I also learned what 2D lists are and how to get a specific element from within those list of lists.,My only question about the content covered today would be in what situation would you use the assert?,

I wasn’t stressed and had time to do sections and take a break if I was overwhelmed  then return to the exam the next day. It gave me time to be able to do research of different methods that could be used and gave me time to brainstorm for the codes. "
