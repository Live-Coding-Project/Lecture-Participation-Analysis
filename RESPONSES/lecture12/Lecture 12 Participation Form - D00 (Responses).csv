",One key idea that I learned today was how to use 2d lists.,I found the topic of nested for loops quite confusing today.,My feedback would be that the review class before the midterm was very helpful. It gave me good practice and put me in good stead to answer the questions on the midterm.

",I learned how to use the index for a 2d list. the first index is for the overall list while the second index is for the list stored within the first index. ,I was initially a little confused about nested loops.,I would have liked more time for the video but the rest of the midterm structure was very good in my opinion
